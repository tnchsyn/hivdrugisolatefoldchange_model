# hivdrugisolatefoldchange_model
In this repository, we aim to share our drug-isolate-fold change based ANN model for predicting the resistance profiles of HIV protease inhibitors. All the results are presented in our paper 
"ANN-based Drug-isolate-fold-change model predicting the resistance profiles of HIV-1 protease inhibitors" on ChemRxiv (https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/61e9c54adeeafa865a2434a2).
